# SpringBootProject
This is a project for an exam surrounding the Spring Boot Framework. It's a pretty simple tierlister. Try it out! 
We were not supposed to have a stylistic frontend, this project's goal was to teach the basics of the backend to frontend relationship. But i love design so i tried out some CSS just to learn myself.
